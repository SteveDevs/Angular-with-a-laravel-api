The application uses a Laravel 6 framework for the API that uses mysql and Angular 2+ for the frontend.

The server is in the products-server folder.
The client is in the products-cleient folder.

The database diagram is included in the file diagram.png.

An intermediate table was included to help with implementaion of future additions of attributes,
(all that would be needed is adding the attriibute to the attribute table).

The API to create a product looks different than the required API requested in the task, due to the implemetion of the intermidate table, for increased flexibility.
